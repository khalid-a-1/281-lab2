# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab02 – Digital Design (PreLab)

#### Overview

This prelab is intended to prepare you properly for the Thursday lab. You should complete this prelab ahead
of time, so that you are ready to use the 2-hour lab period efficiently. There will not be enough time in the
Thursday lab to complete all the activities unless you have completed this prelab in advance.
In this second lab, you will design an important circuit: a multiplexer. You will be required to build the
multiplexer in Thursday’s lab in hardware in two different ways.


## Lab02 – Digital Design

#### Overview

The purpose of this lab is to build on the introductory circuits from last week and design two important circuits
this week. You will design and build a multiplexer and also design and build a 1-bit adder circuit. There are
four parts to the lab.
1. Build a 1 bit adder circuit. Test with switches.
2. Build a 2 to 1 mux out of AND, OR and NOT gates. Test with switches.
3. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with switches.
4. Build a 4 to 1 mux using a 74150 mux chip. Test with Arduino program.

You are to write a lab report that is to be submitted by the Monday (in class) following the lab.
